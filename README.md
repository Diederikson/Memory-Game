Recreating App following FreeCodeCamp tutorial by Rahul Pandey
The problem with learning a new program language using the web is that you go from Hello World to "Now buid the rocket, it should be easy!" in one step.
Rarely do I find courses that will begin at an intermediate level. So that there are morge than a few things you don't understand. that causes you to slow down or even to stop and take 
a detour to find things out. 

With this app I found:
- A challenging starting level at programming
- A complete app that is both interesting and playable
- Enough obstacles to keep the journey interesting 
- A good primer for entering the #100DaysOfCode challenge which I intend to do next
